Considering my heavy curiosity towards Tech, Mathematics and my sheer passion for Astrophysics since childhood, I've tilted my career towards RTL Design. I've tinkered with everything I could find during my undergrad (Linux, android application Reverse engineering, RTL Design, Computer Architectures, pure mathematics), and my list of 'Stuff that I love to to' only grew as I explored more.

Sophomore me and a few of my seniors formed the University's [Entrepreneurship-Cell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/e-cell-rgukt-basara/), to stir up some startup culture on campus, and the journey got helped us meet many, MANY professionals, gave us invites from IITB's E-Summit and Startup Mahakumbh 2024 in Delhi. I have moderated a couple of Panel Discussions in [Development Dialogue](https://developmentdialogue.org/) myself, organised by [Kakatiya Sandbox's](https://kakatiyasandbox.org/), and a few more in my college events.

My whole college experience gave me an exposure I never imagined to get, a deep insight the alienation of country's rural roots from mainstream problem solving pursuit itself and how politics work on the grassroot level.

Right now, I'm working on ML acceleration for Computer Vision models at Vicharak, on their innovative Vaaman boards with reconfigurable computer architecture.
