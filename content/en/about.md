I'm curious about astrophysics, tech and am highly interested in social justice. This portfolio mostly consists of my techie side, with a hint of other stuff as well in an (as you've already figured out) extremely informal tone.

I've tilted my career towards RTL Design cuz of my ever lasting love for mathematics and physics. I've tasted a lil bit of everything I could (Linux, android application Reverse engineering, RTL Design, Computer Architecture, pure mathematics), and my list of 'Stuff I love' only grew as I explored more.

Sophomore me and a few of my seniors formed the University's [Entrepreneurship-Cell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/e-cell-rgukt-basara/), to do smth with our free time, and the journey helped us meet many, MANY cool people, gave us invites from IITB's E-Summit and Startup Mahakumbh 2024 in Delhi. I have moderated a couple of Panel Discussions in [Development Dialogue](https://developmentdialogue.org/), organised by [Kakatiya Sandbox's](https://kakatiyasandbox.org/), and a few more in my college events.

My whole college experience gave me an exposure I never imagined to get, insights about the alienation of country's rural roots from mainstream problem solving pursuit itself and how politics work on the grassroot level.

Right now, I'm working on ML acceleration at [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in/).
