I'm Lalith, and am curious about tech and social justice. This site mostly consists of my techie side, with a hint of other stuff as well in an (as you've already figured out) extremely informal tone.

I've tilted my career towards RTL Design cuz why not (ps. I like mathematics and physics). I've tasted a lil bit of everything I could (Linux, android application Reverse engineering, RTL Design, Computer Architecture, pure mathematics), and my list of 'Stuff I love' only grew.

Sophomore me and a few of my seniors formed the University's [Entrepreneurship-Cell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/e-cell-rgukt-basara/), to do smth with our free time, met many, MANY cool people, got ourselves invites from huge events like Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. I've also moderated a couple of Panel Discussions in [Development Dialogue](https://developmentdialogue.org/), organised by [Kakatiya Sandbox's](https://kakatiyasandbox.org/), and a few more in my college events.

My college gave me an exposure I never imagined to get, insights about the alienation of country's rural roots from the problem solving pursuit itself and how politics work on the grassroot level.

Right now, I'm working on ML acceleration at [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in/).
