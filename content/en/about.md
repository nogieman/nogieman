I'm someone who's curious about astrophysics, tech and highly interested in social justice and climate change.

This portfolio mostly consists of my techie side, with a hint of other stuff as well in an (as you've already figured out) extremely informal tone.

I'm currently working as an FPGA Developer, exploring various ways and applications of reconfigurable edge ML acceleration.
