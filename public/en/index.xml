      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m someone who&amp;rsquo;s curious about astrophysics, tech and highly interested in social justice and climate change. This portfolio mostly consists of my techie side, with a hint of other stuff as well in an (as you&amp;rsquo;ve already figured out) extremely informal tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering my heavy curiosity towards Tech, mathematics and my sheer passion for astrophysics since childhood, I&amp;rsquo;ve tilted my career towards RTL Design. I&amp;rsquo;ve tasted a lil bit of everything I could during my undergrad (Linux, android application Reverse engineering, RTL Design, Computer Architecture, pure mathematics), and my list of &amp;lsquo;Stuff I love&amp;rsquo; only grew as I explored more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as an FPGA Developer, exploring various ways and applications of reconfigurable edge ML acceleration. I&amp;rsquo;m also very passionate about Linux and computer architecture in general. The whole flow of data from compilers to memory drives via the processor with an assembler, all done by tiny-ass transistors and funny lines on a green board is extremely fascinating for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
